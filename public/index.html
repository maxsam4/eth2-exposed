        <h1><b>ETH2</b> Exposed</h1>
        <h2>ETH2 does not exist, it's all psyops. ETH is the wei.</h2>
        <p>A major upgrade to Ethereum is coming soon that'll transition Ethereum from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. The upgrade is commonly known as "The Merge" and sometimes incorrectly called "ETH2".</p>
        <p>There is no new ETH2 blockchain. The current Ethereum blockchain will be upgraded to Proof of Stake very soon.</p>
